Pop OS sometimes manages to mess up somehow, leaving me unable to update.
This is the usual error:

​```
dpkg: dependency problems prevent processing triggers for libglib2.0-0:i386:
 libglib2.0-0:i386 depends on libpcre3; however:
  Package libpcre3:i386 is not configured yet.
​```

Running these two commands usually fixes that:

​```
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt --fix-broken install
​```

This is what the first command does, according to the dpkg man page:
​```
--configure package...|-a|--pending
           Configure a package which has been unpacked but not yet
           configured.  If -a or --pending is given instead of package, all
           unpacked but unconfigured packages are configured.
​```
