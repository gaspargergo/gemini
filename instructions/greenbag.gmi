#Leaving plants alone for a long time
 
Plants can stay alive alone in a terrarium-like container for a long time. To achieve this, seal a plant (with the soil evenly moist, ie. 2-3 days after watering) in a plastic bag with a twist knot at the end. The plant should not be in direct sunlight, since the heat would be too much. The plastic covering will make sure that the water does not evaporate, while also creating a humid environment. Because of this, the technique can not only used for preservation, but for creating a "mini-greenhouse" for plants that like a lot of humidity, eg. avocados. The only plants which do not tolerate this are succulents (cacti, aloes, etc.). Putting them away from direct sunlight is good enough.
